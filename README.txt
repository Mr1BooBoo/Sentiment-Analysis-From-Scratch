- Please feel free to read the code in google colab where it was originally written. Using this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MAudl6fC6OIGMb7LgY7b9LWJuNpX-aIf?usp=sharing
- If you use the google colab please upload the train_data.json and test_data.json by dragging and dropping them in the "Files" section to the left of the screen because the code assumes they are there.
- Alternativly you can upload the files to your drive and connect drive to the notebook and set the new paths.

- If you use other local IDEs please look for the "file_path" and "file_path_test" in the code and change the Location/URL to where you have the train/test jasons on your device.
- You can already see last results i ran below each cell, or run all cells to verify that it all works as intended yourself

- Lastly if you want to use the .py version, look for the "file_path" and "file_path_test" and change the link to where the train/test jasons are on your device.


thank you for your patience
