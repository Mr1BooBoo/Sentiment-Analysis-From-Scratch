# Sentiment-Analysis-From-Scratch

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This documentation explores the application of sentiment analysis on chat conversations, specifically classifying each message into one of seven basic emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, or Neutral. The analysis utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
